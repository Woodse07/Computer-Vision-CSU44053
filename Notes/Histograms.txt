Histograms

- 1D Histograms
	- Determine frequency of brightness values
	  - Initialise h(z) = 0 for all values of z
	  - For all pixels (i,j): h(f(i,j))++
	  - Would this be useful?
	  - ** code here (greyscale histogram) **
	
	- Smoothing
	  - Local minima & maxima are useful.
	  - How can we deal with noise?
	    - Smoothing the histogram. 
	      - For all values v: h_new(v): (h(v-1), + h(v) + h(v+1)) / 3
	    - What do we do at the ends? Don't compute, wraparound, etc.
	  - ** code here (smoothing histogram) **
	
	- Determine histograms for each channel independently.
	
	- Choice of colour space.

	- ** code here (colour histogram) **

- 3D Histograms
	- Channels are not independent.

	- Better discrimination from considering all channels simultaneously.

	- Number of cells? 8 bits = 16,777,216

	- Reduce quantisation...
	  - 6 bits = 262,144
	  - 4 bits = 4096
	  - 2 bits = 62

	- ** code here (3d hist) **

- Equalisation
	- If an image has insufficient contrast.
	
	- Humans can distinguish 700-900 greyscales

	- Evenly distribute the greyscales.. result has missing greyscales

	- Normally equalise only the greyscales / luminance

	- ** code here (?) **

	- ** code here (some functions) **


- Histogram Comparison
	- To find similar images
	  - Use metadata
	  - Compare images

	- Compare colour distributions

	- Need a metric for comparisons.

	- ** some metric formulae.. **

	- Alternative to metrics is to computer the 'Earth Mover's Distance'
	  - Min cost for turning a distribution into another distribution
	  - Compare images.
	  - 1D Solution...
	  - Colour EMD is harder to compute
	  - ** code here (histogram comparison) **



- Back Projection
	- Better approach to selecting colours.

	- Method:
	  1. Obtain a representative sample set of the colours.
	  2. Histogram those samples.
	  3. Normalize that histogram (max value is 1)
	  4. Back project the normalized histogram onto any image f(i,j)
	  5. Will provide a probability image p(i,j) which indicates the similarity between
	     f(i,j) and the sample set.
