- Thresholding
	- Binary Thresholding
	  - Simple Scenes?
	  - LUT
	  - Objects of interest vs Background
	  - ** code here (threshold) **

	- Distinct foreground and background needed for thresholding.

	- How do we determine the best threshold?


- Threshold detection
	- Manual setting
	  - Issue of changing lighting

	- Need to determine automatically.
	
	- For the techniques that follow:
	  - Image: f(i,j)
	  - Histogram: h(g)
	  - Prob Distribution: p(g) = h(g) / sumof(g)[h(g)]

	- Otsu Thresholding
	  - Minimize the spread of the pixels...
	    - Smallest within class variance.
	    - ** Some formulae.. **
	    - Largest between class variance. 
	  - ** Some cofe here (otsu thresh) **


- Variations
	- Adaptive thresholding
	  - Method:
	    1. Divide image into sub-images
	    2. Compute threshold for all sub-images
	    3. Interpolate thresholds for every point using bilinear interpolation.
	  - ** code here (adaptive thresh) **

	- Multi-Spectral Thresholding
	

- Cleaning Binary Images	  
	- Cannot use normal smoothing operations
	
	- Need to remove noisy points and smooth binary region boundaries
	
	- Mostly use operations defined as part of 'mathematical morphology'
	  - Treats images as sets.

	- Most common operations:
	  - Erosion
	  - Dilation
	  - Opening 
	  - Closing	


- Mathematical Morphology
	- Dilation
	  - Minkowski set addition:
	    - X xor B = { p elemof .... look at notes}
	    - B is the structuring element
	    - B is typicaly isotropic

	  - Adds pixels around borders
	
	  - Effects: 
	    - Makes 'regions' bigger
	    - Fills small holes
	    - Joins close 'regions'

	- Erosion
	  - Minkowski set subtraction
	    - X .... check notes
	    - Again, B is typically isotropic

	  - Removes border pixels.

	  - Effects:
	    - Makes 'regions' smaller
	    - Removes noise
	    - Removes narrow bridges

	- Opening
	  - Removes noise
	  - Removes narrow bridges
	  - Maintains 'region' size
	  - Smooths shape

	- Closing
	  - Fills small holes
	  - Joins close 'regions'
	  - Maintains 'region' size

	- ** some code (dilate, erode, etc..) **
